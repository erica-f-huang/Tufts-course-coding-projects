## Project: Array List ADT

## Course: Data Structures (Spring '24)

### The purpose of the program

    The purpose of the program is to implement a character array 
    list data structure. Lists can begin empty, with one character 
    with multiple characters, or as a copy of another list. 
    Clients can then insert, remove, and replace elements in the list. 
    They can also turn it into a string, a reverse string and
    concatenate two lists.

### Provided files + description of each file

    CharArrayList.cpp:  Implementation of the CharArrayList class
    CharArrayList.h:  Class definition and function definition of
                        the CharArrayList class. The class represents
                        a char array list data structure.
    unit_test.h:  Tests made for the functions in CharArrayList.cpp
    Makefile:  Makes it easier to compile and run files
    simple_exception.cpp:  Assists in throwing exceptions
    timer_main.cpp:  "A driver program for timing various 
                        CharArrayList operations"


### How to compile and run program

    unit_test both compiles and runs my program

### An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used. 

    The ADT is an Array List, which is an array with dynamically 
    allocated memory, so we can change the size after initializing 
    them, which is a major advantage. Another advantage is that 
    you can access elements with O(1) efficiency. Some 
    disadvantages are that when adding and removing elements, we 
    have to shift other elements to the right of the element we 
    are adding or removing. This takes up a lot of time the closer 
    we are to the front of the array list. Another disadvantage is 
    the time vs space tradeoff when increasing capacity. If you 
    want to increase capacity while saving time, multiply it. 
    However, this will take up alot of space. If you want to take 
    up less space, add onto capacity. However, this will increase 
    the time it takes as you have more data. The data structure 
    behing array lists are arrays. We used this because it was the 
    most similar to array lists, as they are both accessed and 
    used in similar ways. The only difference is that array lists 
    can change sinzes. Algorithms include adding and removing 
    elements along the list, accessing elements, turning elements 
    into one string, and adding a list to the end of another. One 
    of the most complex ones in my opinion was the insert at, 
    because there are a lot of edge cases.
